  %h2 University Program
  %p The IEEE Hands on Practical Electronics (HOPE) Program serves as an exciting introduction to the topic of electrical engineering for many students who traditionally would not have the opportunity to explore the field. Although Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) is a very popular major at UC Berkeley, many students in the major do not take a single EE class until their 3rd semester. Further, students who enter UC Berkeley as "engineering undeclared" have no way of gauging their interest in the EECS major without committing to a challenging EECS class and thus may choose to major in another area that they better understand. Thus for these freshmen EECS majors and engineering undeclared majors, this course provides a thorough yet fun and low-pressure introduction to the field. By allowing students to learn by constructing a relevant circuit with every lesson, students will begin to gain an intuition for EE and be able to see tangible results of their newly acquired knowledge. Thus the class will provide a motivation to these freshmen EECS majors who spend their first year studying math and physics and encouragement to those considering adopting it from engineering undeclared. Equally important, this course will appeal to non EECS majors and humanities majors.
  %p While many studying the humanities have an image of EE being a mysterious and complicated realm into which they would dare not venture, we provide them with the opportunity to banish these stereotypes and learn both how enjoyable and accessible the field really is. As the course does not rely upon complicated math and we work with the assumption that the students know nothing about electricity, humanities majors face no disadvantages. And because the course focuses on tangible circuits instead of more abstract textbook knowledge, it is easy to relate to and become excited by. Humanities majors have no other opportunity to learn about EE as even the introductory EE courses have numerous math and physics requirements. Humanities majors can emerge from the course as both informed consumers who are not intimidated by technology and able to understand the goals and trends of modern EE.
  %h2 High School Program
  %p Motivated by the success of the "IEEE's Hands on Practical Electronics Class," the UC Berkeley IEEE Student Branch (IEEE) today launched a similar 10 week series of lessons for local East Bay high school students. Starting this Saturday morning, IEEE offered the first eighty minute lesson to an eager audience of 16 high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors. In the spirit of the DeCal class which stresses intuition over equations, the lesson centered upon hands on electrical engineering. After a thirty minute presentation on what IEEE is, the work that electrical engineers perform, and the day's circuit, students were provided with the tools and supplies to turn their newfound theoretical knowledge into tangible circuits. IEEE officers were present to help students build the circuits and clear up any confusion. While this first lesson involved the construction of a simple circuit, later ones will teach RC circuits, the foundation of semiconductor physics, introductions to transistors, and digital logic. Near the end of the course, students will work on a final project that integrates all their hands on electronics lessons into one exciting and practical circuit. Thanks to a generous grant from the IEEE University Partnership Program, all supplies and materials are presented free of charge to students. IEEE community service officer Ashik Manandhar coordinated publicity and recruitment for the class among local high schools.
