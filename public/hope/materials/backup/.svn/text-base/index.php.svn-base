		<h2>High School HOPE Course Completed</h2>
		<p>
IEEE's Hands on Electronics DeCal and High School Program recently changed its name to Hands on Practical Electronics (HOPE). While the name may be new, the goals of the program remain the same: introducing electrical engineering in a fun, intuitive, and of course hands on manner to freshmen EECS majors, as well as students studying humanities and local high school students who otherwise would not be exposed to this subject. Currently, Berkeley IEEE is teaching its third semester of Hands on Practical Electronics to twenty five Berkeley students, and is preparing to start a second high school at Oakland Tech, in Oakland. Berkeley IEEE is also working with Stanford Universityâ€™s IEEE branch to start a similar course for their students.

The response from the article has been overwhelming. We have received positive comments and interest from universities and individuals alike around the globe. If you have yet to receive a response from us, don't worry, we are trying to respond as thoroughly as possible. For a program that only began a year ago, we are excited that so many people want to start similar programs in the spirit of Hands on Electronics.

		<h2>Windows Programming Decal</h2>
		<p>
This semester, IEEE will be hosting a second decal titled "Using Microsoft Technologies to Program for the Windows Operating System." The course will cover Microsoft's .NET framework, Visual Studio 2005, developing for mobile devices such as PDAs, and most importantly, the C# programming language. The curriculum is tailored to students who have a fair understanding of programming (cs61a and cs61b are prerequisites) and are interested in applying their skills on the Windows platform. Microsoft Corporation is sponsoring the decal and will be providing free copies of Visual Studio 2005, as well as textbooks. The course will be held weekly on Tuesdays from 5-6pm.
